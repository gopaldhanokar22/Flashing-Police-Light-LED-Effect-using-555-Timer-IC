Flashing Police Light LED Effect using 555 Timer IC

The Blinking Police Light LED Effect Using 555 Timer project on Instructables uses a 555 timer and CD4017 decade counter IC to create a blinking police light. The project explains how the first 555 timer IC's output turns on, causing the first group of LEDs to light up and blink at the speed of the second 555 timer IC's output toggle. When the first 555 timer IC turns off, the second group of LEDs light up and blink at the speed of the second 555 timer IC's output toggle. This cycle repeats, creating an LED flasher effect similar to the lights on police cars.
